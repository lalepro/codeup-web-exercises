========= GIT BRANCHING

Everything we have done is on the "master branch" in Git

New best practice work flow...don't commit in the local master branch; always add and commit in another branch!

--> FIRST STEP
Create and switch to a new branch in your Git local repo
(suggested branch name: yourName-exerciseOrFeature)...
Command: git checkout -b "justin-box-model"

--> SECOND STEP
Add and commit changes as you normally would...
Command: git add someFile, git commit someFile, etc.

--> THIRD STEP
Merge local branch with the local master branch...
Commands:
1) git checkout master
2) git merge whateverBranchName

OR

Discard work from branch and DON'T merge with the local master branch...
Commands:
1) git checkout master
optionally...
2) git branch -D whateverBranchName (deletes the branch and all the work you committed!)

--> FOURTH STEP
Push up changes from local master branch to remote repository (GitHub repo)...
Command: git push origin master

To list all created branches...
Command: git branch
